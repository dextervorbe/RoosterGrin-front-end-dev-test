# Front-End Development Test
To run application clone the repo then run the following commands in the terminal

Followed by

```
npm run start
```
NOTE: You will need node and npm on your machine if you choose to use the supplied server, also for hosting you will need to set it up yourself.

## Introduction
This test is designed to assess your creativity, coding ability, and attention to detail in front-end web development. You are expected to know about running a local server, connecting markup to scripts and styles, and general front-end web development. 

## Instructions
The goal of this project is to create a client website based on the design requirements and features requested by the client (Rooster Grin).

## Design Requirements
- Follow the mockups provided in the .zip folder
- Include a carousel in the last section
- Pay attention to detail
- Ensure that the website is mobile-responsive
- Implement animations

## Technical Requirements
- Write modular and concise code
- Ensure that all built features are fully functional
- Avoid errors when clicking buttons
- Follow best practices in web development
- Adhere to naming conventions and styling
- Optimize use of images and assets
- Implement a grid system

## Required Features
- Fade-in effect for the hero title
- Subtle animation on the four icons
- Fully functional website

## Bonus (Optional) Features
- Use of a dev server
- Front-end framework
- Dynamic backend from a CMS

## Technology Used
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- React

I decided to use these technologies so I can get a better understanding of react. I also attempted to use a few npm packages and some bootstrap but I decided I did not need them for this project.

## Challenges
- Mobile Responsiveness 
- Carousel
- Animations
- Image alignment
- Deployment

One of the challenges that I faced while working on this project was adding the carousel and animations for the icons and hero titles. However, I was able to overcome this challenge and improve my knowledge of react hooks in the process
